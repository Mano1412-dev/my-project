Azure DevOps must authenticate to Azure.

Go to:

Project Settings → Service Connections
→ New Service Connection
→ Choose Azure Resource Manager

Choose:

✔ Service principal (automatic)
✔ Select subscription
✔ Give name: azure-terraform-connection
✔ Grant access to all pipelines

Save.

Now Azure DevOps can deploy to your subscription.
